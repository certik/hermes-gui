Hermes GUI
----------

This is a Python based GUI for Hermes, currently only Hermes2D.

Features
--------

  * look and feel similar to Agros2D (http://hpfem.org/agros2d/)
  * written and scriptable from Python (easy to maintain, easy to call any
    solvers/external programs)
  * works both with wxWidgets (GTK) and QT4
  * written using Python Traits, thus no toolkit dependent code is used, it's
    very easy to reuse any other traits editors and quickly create new
    interfaces
  * no dependencies, besides Traits, so it's easy to install it, yet it
    is still very easy to call any solvers, like scipy, petsc, umfpack, ...,
    thanks to their python wrappers
  * plugins based architecture, very easy to create new functionality as a
    plugin
  * BSD licensed

Installation
------------

As usual:

$ python setup.py install

or if you want some specific prefix, use:

$ python setup.py install --home=/some/path
